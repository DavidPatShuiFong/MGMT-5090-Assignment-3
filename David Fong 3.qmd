## Introduction

Infectious disease epidemic crises have repeatedly challenged the nations and peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. From HIV (1990s -- 2000s) to tuberculosis to Ebola (2014 -- 2016) and COVID-19 (2020 -- 2022), each emergent crisis -- sometimes originating in Africa, sometimes part of wider global pandemic and sometimes overlapping each other -- has presented novel and life-threatening landscape-scale threats to communities throughout sub-Saharan Africa [@kimani2020]. Each infectious disease crisis has been characterised by difficulties in collecting information to inform situational awareness, difficulties in formulating and implementing effective management plans, difficulties in disseminating information, widespread public fear and widespread social and economic impacts.

Effective healthcare response to infectious disease depends on the ability to deploy an available, well-trained and well-informed healthcare workforce. However, many of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa are -- and have been -- lacking in adequate healthcare resources [@cancedda2016; @paterson2017]. Weak governments, stagnant economies and neo-liberal policies have resulted in reduced expenditure on social services, such as healthcare [@okma2016]. The publicly-funded health sector often has weak governance and management systems [@internationalrescuecommittee2016]. Similarly, developing countries in Africa have limited resources to implement welfare and anti-poverty measures to mitigate the economic and social effects of an infectious disease epidemic and the adverse consequences of epidemic control measures [@gutierrez-romero2020].

In the midst of inadequate resources to manage the health, social and economic impacts of infectious disease epidemic crises, developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa are also faced with pre-existing endemic poverty [@gutierrez-romero2020]. With poverty comes many other high-priority health concerns, such as high rates of maternal and child mortality, chronic malnutrition and low levels of education [@sasidharan2021, p. 19]. These other concerns can easily divert attention away from infectious disease epidemic crises [@carstensen2021].

Infectious disease epidemics can, however, be anticipated. An increasing number of infections, often zoonotic, have crossed over into humans in the past two decades, and an increasing number are expected to do so [@dvorak2020].

In the face of gaps in government-provided social and healthcare services, community-based (CBO) and other non-government (NGO) organisations have arisen to provide those services [@okma2016]. Given that infectious disease epidemics can be anticipated, and the healthcare and social consequences thereof, can community-based organisations (CBOs) which already provide social and healthcare services be employed to assist in epidemic crisis response? What are the potential contributions, strengths and weaknesses of CBO humanitarian responses to infectious disease crises?

In potential favour of community-based organisation (CBO) response to the humanitarian consequences of healthcare crises are that they typically have local knowledge and presence, both before and after the healthcare crisis [@carstensen2021; @kieffer-døssing2020]. Already adapted to local conditions, they potentially have local situation awareness, insight into cultural beliefs, can tailor epidemic responses and potentially be more responsive to unanticipated effects of epidemic responses. A diversity of observations, opinions and approaches -- different to that of larger organisations and government organisations -- has the potential to improve situational awareness and provide effective response to complex humanitarian problems [@clarke2013]. Their smaller size may enable them to respond more quickly and flexibly to crises [@hushie2021; @kieffer-døssing2020]. If they have strong connections to the community, CBOs can mobilise and empower communities through public education, including recruitment and training of local staff to aid in the humanitarian response [@hushie2021; @paterson2017]. CBOs with a strong level of 'ownership' by the community have the potential to improve the effectiveness of crisis responses by providing social trust and cohesion to the response measure [@tiberghien2022]. CBOs with good community relationships can improve relationships between the community and health centres and hospital [@hushie2021] and advocate for the community to government authorities and other organisations [@carstensen2021].

However, CBOs are likely to have weaknesses in the comprehensiveness and co-ordination of crisis response. Crisis response is not the routine business of CBOs. Staff, staff training, overall strategy and funding may be orientated and linked to typical development goals, slowing the ability of CBOs to provide crisis response services [@internationalrescuecommittee2016]. A CBO, like other organisations, may have difficulty flexibly adapting to needs of a crisis response [@leonard2009]. The role and services provided by any individual CBO may be relatively narrow in scope and not reflect the comprehensive response required to a crisis [@carstensen2021]. A CBO's crisis response will often need to be supported and informed by expert external organisations. Individual CBO resources -- including the use of community volunteers -- may be limited and rapidly exhausted [@carstensen2021]. CBOs may have poor linkages and information sharing with government, other large non-governmental organisations and other CBOs, reducing their ability to co-ordinate a comprehensive response. Government organisations may be unwilling to acknowledge the potential or actual role of non-governmental organisations in crisis management and recovery [@colten2008].

A flattened structure for awareness, but a more hierarchical structure for execution [@leonard2009a].

This article will examine past and potential contributions of community-based organisations to the humanitarian response to infectious disease crises affecting vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Community-based organisations can provide a decentralised, localised and adaptive responses to epidemic crises, but much can be done to prepare to strengthen the leadership and co-ordination in those responses [@clarke2014; @leonard2010].

## Infectious disease crises and social welfare

Infectious disease crises cause losses of social welfare [@vardavas2021; @leonard2010a]. Infectious disease outbreaks in sub-Saharan countries have caused loss of life, morbidity, reduction in individual economic prosperity, loss of education opportunity, destruction of skilled labour and loss of much-needed economic development [@boutayeb2010].

However, there are potential measures, including cost-effective measures, to reduce the loss of social welfare from infectious disease epidemics [@vardavas2021]. There is even the potential to increase social welfare through increasing community resilience [@australianbusinessroundtablefordisasterresilienceandsafercommunities2017]. Skill building, reducing the uncertainty of potential future losses and improved community connections can not only reduce the cost of a disaster but -- even in the absence of disaster -- improve social welfare.

## Reducing social welfare loss and the Comprehensive Risk Management Framework

@leonard2010a suggest that opportunities and measures to reduce social loss from disasters can be divided into those taking place prior to the disaster event, during the disaster event and after the disaster event.

-   Before the disaster event

    -   'Prevention/mitigation' -- Reduce the probability or severity of the event

    -   'Preparation for response' -- Prepare to respond rapidly and effectively to the event

    -   'Advance recovery' -- Prepare for a rapid, complete recovery, reducing the consequences of the event

-   During and immediately after the event

    -   'Response' -- Reduce the damage from the event, ministering to human needs

-   After the event

    -   'Recovery' -- Promote rapid, complete recovery. Restore social welfare.

Community-based organisations (CBOs) in sub-Saharan Africa have the potential to assist in all stages of managing the risk of an infectious disease crisis. For example, CBOs are often already involved in reducing the risk of water-borne and sexually-transmitted disease outbreaks. Risk prevention and mitigation measures include providing education -- including about the nature and importance of infectious disease -- and enabling access to cleaner water and contraceptive services.

Five leverage points for reducing social loss from disasters [@leonard2010a].

-   Prevention mitigation

    -   Hygiene, living conditions, education

-   Prepare for response and the response

    -   Getting ready for rapid, effective response to an event

    -   Reduce damage in progress and minister to human needs

-   Advance recovery and recovery

    -   Creating conditions that will make recovery faster, less costly and more complete

    -   Restoring social welfare as soon as possible

Both public and private organisations typically devote more resources towards activities and few resources to gathering information to detect or monitor a potential crisis [@boin2016].
